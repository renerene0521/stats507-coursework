# stats507-coursework

This repository is for my coursework in **Stats 507: Data Science and Statistical Computing**.  
Here I will organize homework, projects, and practice code that I work on during the semester.  

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of my progress and share my learning experience in the course.  
Please note that homework solutions will only be uploaded **after the due date**, according to course policy.
